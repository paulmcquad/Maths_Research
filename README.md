| **Preferred Topic Order** |
|---|
| [Foundations of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics) is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. |
| [Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. |
| [Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis) is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, sequences, series, and analytic functions. |
| [Discrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics) is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous to discrete spaces in topology in which all points are isolated from each other) rather than "continuous" (analogously to continuous functions). |
| [Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. |
| [Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. |
| [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself. |
| [Applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics) is the application of mathematical methods by different fields such as physics, engineering, medicine, biology, finance, business, computer science, and industry. |
| [Computational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics) involves mathematical research in mathematics as well as in areas of science where computation plays a central and essential role, and emphasizes algorithms, numerical methods, and symbolic computations. |
| [Related topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics) cover a variety of topics related to  mathematics. |
