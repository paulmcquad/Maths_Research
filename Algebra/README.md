| [Pre Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-algebra) is to prepare students for the study of algebra. Usually algebra is taught in the 8th and 9th grade. |
| [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. |
| [Commutative Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra) is the branch of algebra that studies commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. |
| [Algebraic Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve) is an algebraic variety of dimension one. |
| [Algebraic Surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface) is an algebraic variety of dimension two. |
| [Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations and linear maps. |
| [Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is an expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables. |
| [Quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form) is a polynomial with terms all of degree two ("form" is another name for a homogeneous polynomial). |
| [Galois Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory) allows reducing certain problems in field theory to group theory, which makes them simpler and easier to understand. |
